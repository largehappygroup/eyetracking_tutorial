### Eye-tracking Tutorial for Code Comprehension
My goal with this tutorial is to show other lab-members/researchers how to map raw eye-tracking coordinates to code on the computer monitor. From here, there may be language-specific parsers you can use to discern some semantic information from the code (i.e., srcML in Java).

#### Step 0. Data Inputs
There should be two primary forms of data input for mapping gaze coordinates to the stimuli: raw eye-tracking files and screenshots of the stimuli.
